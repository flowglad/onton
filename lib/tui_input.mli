(** Pure keyboard input → TUI command translation.

    Maps {!Term.Key.t} values to semantic TUI commands. Contains no I/O — the
    reading of keys from stdin is the caller's responsibility. *)

val of_key : Term.Key.t -> command
(** Translate a key press into a TUI command. *)

val apply_move : count:int -> selected:int -> command -> int
(** Apply a navigation command to the selected index.

    Returns the new selected index, clamped to [[0, count-1]]. Non-navigation
    commands clamp [selected] to the valid range (guarding against asynchronous
    count shrinkage). Returns [0] when [count <= 0]. *)
